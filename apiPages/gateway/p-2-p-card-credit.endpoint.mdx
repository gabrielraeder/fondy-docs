{/* Don't change the file name or the metadata in this file */}
This endpoint allows a merchant to perform a peer-to-peer (P2P) card credit transaction, transferring funds directly to a recipient's card number or a stored receiver token. The request must include either `receiver_card_number` or `receiver_rectoken`, along with transaction details such as `order_id`, `order_desc`, and `amount`.

To secure this request, the merchant must generate a signature using their Credit private key specifically for `p2pcredit` operations.
