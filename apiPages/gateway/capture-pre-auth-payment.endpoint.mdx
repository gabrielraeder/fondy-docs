This endpoint allows a merchant to capture a previously pre-authorized amount on a card. The capture operation is the second stage in a two-stage payment scheme, where the initial amount was held during a pre-authorization request (`preauth = Y`). This capture can be a full or partial capture of the amount.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> This operation applies only to card payments. If capture is not completed, only a reversal of the full held amount is available.
