This endpoint enables you to generate a payment and receive a token to create payment forms in your system. Using one of the Fondy solutions, you will use the generated token to mount the payment form. When your customer finishes the payment, adding the payment method information, Fondy will use a token generated by this endpoint to link the payment created with the payment information provided by your client.
