To ensure the security of your transactions, all API requests To Fondy Gateway must be made over HTTPS using the **POST** method. The Fondy Gateway API uses a parameter called `signature` to authenticate requests. This signature is a SHA-1 hash the merchant generates using their payment key.

The `signature` is the parameter that will secure communication. You must generate the `signature` for each API request using your payment key. Follow the steps outlined in the [Signatures](/docs/signatures) documentation page to create and use it correctly.

Below is an example of an API request to create a payment link. The `signature` is sent as part of the `request` object.


  ```bash 
  curl -L 'https://pay.fondy.com/api/checkout/url' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
     "request": {
       "server_callback_url": "http://myshop/callback/",
       "order_id": "TestOrder2",
       "currency": "USD",
       "merchant_id": 1396424,
       "order_desc": "Test payment",
       "amount": 1000,
       "signature": "91ea7da493a8367410fe3d7f877fb5e0ed666490"
     }
  }'
  ```


<Callout type="info" title="Test Payment Key">
  To test your integration, use the test payment key, merchant ID, and cards provided in the [Test Gateway Payments](/docs/test-gateway-payments).

  When you are testing, the Fondy Gateway API response may include an additional parameter, `response_signature_string`. This parameter is not available in production.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
  * Do not use your production keys or sensitive information while testing your integration.
  * Verify the signature in each API response. This helps ensure the integrity of the communication between your application and the Fondy Gateway.
