The Fondy Gateway API is a complete solution for implementing various online payment scenarios. It provides multiple endpoints, each designed for specific operations, enabling you to build payment flows of any complexity.

The Fondy Gateway API has the following characteristics:

-   **Versatile Payment Options**: Support for card payments, 3D Secure, subscriptions, splits, mobile wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay), Open Banking, local payment methods (iDEAL, Klarna, Blik, Sofort), and more.
-   **Flexible Data Format**: Choose between FORM-encoded or JSON-encoded request and response bodies based on your preference.
-   **Custom Payment Flows**: Create custom payment workflows tailored to your business needs.

The Gateway API authenticates via signatures. Every request must include a valid signature to ensure secure communication. To learn more about creating and using signatures, visit the [Signatures](/reference/signatures) page. For additional details on authentication, access the [Authentication](/reference/gateway/authentication) page.

To use the Gateway API, you must follow a specific structure for sending data and interpreting responses. For detailed instructions on the request structure, visit the [Request Structure](/request-structure) page.
