# Fondy Flow API

The Fondy Flow API is designed to provide a secure and streamlined method for onboarding partners, creating wallets, and creating payments and payouts. It includes a single endpoint, the [Encrypted Request](/reference/encrypted), which requires the encryption of all requests and responses to ensure data security and integrity.

The Fondy Flow API has the following characteristics:

* **Encryption**: All data is encrypted using a combination of AES and RSA encryption to ensure maximum security.
* **Digital Signing**: Requests and responses are digitally signed for authenticity and integrity.
* **Secure Communication**: The API ensures secure communication between your application and Fondyâ€™s servers.

The basic steps to use the [Encrypted Request](/reference/flow/encrypted) endpoint are the following:

1. **Encryption**: Encrypt your requested data using the required encryption standards.
2. **Digital Signing**: Sign the encrypted data to ensure authenticity.
3. **Send Request**: Send the signed and encrypted request to the Encrypted Endpoint.
4. **Decryption**: Decrypt the response data to access the required information.
