This operation allows you to create a compliance profile for a client in the system. This page will guide you through this process; see the following sections for more details.

<Callout type="warning" title="Encrypted Requests">
  All requests into the stack are performed using the [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted), where the request and response of the operation are encrypted. See [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to learn how to encrypt your operations and send them through the endpoint.
</Callout>

## Request

The request process of this operation consists of the following two steps:

1. [Create the payload](#step-1-create-the-payload)
2. [Make the encrypted request](#step-2-make-the-encrypted-request)

See the sections below for more details on each step.

### Step 1: Create the Payload

The identity information must be sent to the payload. See the code block below for an example:

```json
{
  "external_id": "ExampleRefId_43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f",
  "profile_type": "SOLETRADER",
  "full_name": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "telephone": "string"
}
```

Where:

| **Field**      | **Description**                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `external_id`  | Unique reference ID for the profile.           |
| `profile_type` | Type of profile.                               |
| `full_name`    | Full name of the individual or company.        |
| `email`        | Email address of the individual or company.    |
| `telephone`    | Telephone number of the individual or company. |

Once you create the payload it has to be encrypted, see the following section for more details.

### Step 2: Make the encrypted request

To create a wallet under a split account, follow the steps below:

1. Follow the steps in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to encrypt your request into the stack.
2. Send the encrypted operation using [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted). See an example in the code block below:
   ```json
   {
       "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(profileObject),
       "encrypted_user": ENCRYPTED(<username>),    
       "encrypted_url": ENCRYPTED("/onboarding/compliance/profile"),
       "method": "POST"
   }
   ```

In the request `ENCRYPTED(identityObject)` is the payload previously created, which is now encrypted.

## Response

A successful request will return the encrypted response, as in the code block below:

```json
{
    "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(profileObject)
    "encrypted_url": null
    "method": null
    "nonce": null
}
```

This response has to be decrypted using the process explained in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api). Once it is decrypted, the unencrypted payload is as follows:

```json
{
  "id": "43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f",
  "external_id": "ExampleRefId_43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f",
  "external_url_validation": "string",
  "client_ref": "43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f",
  "profile_type": "SOLETRADER",
  "full_name": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "telephone": "string",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "created_date": "2020-01-22T13:15:30Z",
  "linked_identities": [
    "43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f"
  ]
}
```

Where:

| **Field**                 | **Description**                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                      | Unique identifier for the created profile.                             |
| `external_id`             | Reference ID for the profile, matches the one provided in the request. |
| `external_url_validation` | URL used to validate the external ID (if applicable).                  |
| `client_ref`              | Client reference ID associated with the profile.                       |
| `profile_type`            | Type of profile.                                                       |
| `full_name`               | Full name of the individual or company associated with the profile.    |
| `email`                   | Email address associated with the profile.                             |
| `telephone`               | Telephone number associated with the profile.                          |
| `status`                  | Current status of the profile.                                         |
| `created_date`            | Timestamp when the profile was created.                                |
| `linked_identities`       | List of linked identity IDs associated with the profile.               |
