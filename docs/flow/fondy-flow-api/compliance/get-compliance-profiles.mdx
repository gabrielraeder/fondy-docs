By calling this operation, you can get a comprehensive list of all Compliance profiles of a client, or you can focus on retrieving details of a specific profileby its unique ID.

This page will guide you trough the process of using these operations:

* [Retrieve All Profiles](#retrieve-all-profiles)
* [Retrieve Specific Profile](#retrieve-specific-profile)

The following sections will describe them in more detail.

<Callout type="warning" title="Encrypted Requests">
  All requests into the stack are performed using the [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted), where the request and response of the operation are encrypted. See [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to learn how to encrypt your operations and send them through the endpoint.
</Callout>

## Retrieve All Profiles

To retrieve a list of all profiles under a client follow the steps below:

1. Follow the steps in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to learn how to encrypt your request into the stack.
2. Send the encrypted operation using [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted). See an example in the code block below:
   ```json
   {
       "encrypted_payload": null,
       "encrypted_user": ENCRYPTED(<username>),    
       "encrypted_url": ENCRYPTED("/onboarding/compliance/profile"),
       "method": "GET"
   }
   ```

### Response

A succesful request will return the encrypted response, as in the code block below:

```json
{
    "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(profiles)
    "encrypted_url": null
    "method": null
}
```

This response has to be decrypted with the process explained in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api). Once you decrypt it, the unencrypted payload is as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "profile_type": "SOLETRADER",
    "full_name": "string",
    "external_url_validation": "string",
    "client_ref": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
    "type_of_compliance": "EXTERNAL_FULL",
    "external_id": "ExampleRefId_43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f",
    "telephone": "string",
    "id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
    "created_date": "2020-01-22T13:15:30.000Z",
    "email": "string",
    "linked_identities": [
      "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a"
    ],
    "status": null
  }
]
```

The parameters for each profile are the same received in the response of the [Create Compliance Profile](/flow/fondy-flow-api/compliance/create-compliance-profile) operation.

## Retrieve Specific Profile

To retrieve information of a specific profile under a client follow the steps below:

1. Follow the steps in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to encrypt your request into the stack.
2. Send the encrypted operation using [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted). See an example in the code block below:
   ```json
   {
       "encrypted_payload": null,
       "encrypted_user": ENCRYPTED(<username>),    
       "encrypted_url": ENCRYPTED("/onboarding/compliance/profile/{complianceId}"),
       "method": "GET"
   }
   ```

<Callout type="warning" title="Path Parameters">
  Change the following in the `encrypted_url`

  * Change `{complianceId}` with the ID of the Identity to retrieve the details from.
</Callout>

### Response

A succesful request will return the encrypted response, as in the code block below:

```json
{
    "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(profile)
    "encrypted_url": null
    "method": null
}
```

This response has to be decrypted with the process explained in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api). Once you decrypt it, the unencrypted payload is as follows:

```json
{
  "profile_type": "SOLETRADER",
  "full_name": "string",
  "external_url_validation": "string",
  "client_ref": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
  "type_of_compliance": "EXTERNAL_FULL",
  "external_id": "ExampleRefId_43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f",
  "telephone": "string",

  "linked_identities": [
    "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a"
  ],
  "status": null
}
```
