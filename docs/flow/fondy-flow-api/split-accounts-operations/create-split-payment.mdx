This operation allows you to initiate a payment from a wallet under a specific Split Account. Depending on the transaction type, you can trigger different operations, such as transfers, reversals, or payouts.

This page explains how to structure the request for each operation type and the payload details required for each.

<Callout type="warning" title="Encrypted Requests">
  All requests into the stack are performed using the [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted), where the request and response of the operation are encrypted. See [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to learn how to encrypt your operations and send them through the endpoint.
</Callout>

## Transaction Types

There are different types of operation in Fondy Flow, these are:

* **Transfer** (Master > Specific Wallet): This operation allows you to transfer funds from the master wallet to a specific wallet under the Split Account.
* **Reversal** (Wallet > Master): This operation allows you to reverse a previous payment, transferring funds back from a specific wallet to the master wallet.
* **Payout** (Master or Wallet): This operation enables payouts from either the master wallet or a specific wallet under the Split Account.

For each operation, you will need to specify the relevant source and target wallets, as well as the amount and other transaction details.

## Request

The request process of this operation consists of the following two steps:

1. [Create the payload](#step-1-create-the-payload)
2. [Make the encrypted request](#step-2-make-the-encrypted-request)

See the sections below for more details on each step.

### Step 1: Create the payload

The information on the wallet must be sent to the payload. See the code block below for an example:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="transfer" label="Transfer" default>
  ```json
  {
    "source_wallet_id": "1111-1222-2333-33aab-bcc9",
    "target_wallet_id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
    "requested_amount": {
      "amount": 15500,
      "currency": "GBP"
    },
    "type": "TRANSFER",
    "external_id": "ExampleRefId_43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f",
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="reversal" label="Reversal">
  ```json 
  {
    "source_wallet_id": "1111-1222-2333-33aab-bcc9",
    "target_wallet_id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
    "requested_amount": {
      "amount": 15500,
      "currency": "GBP"
    },
    "type": "REVERSAL",
    "external_id": "ExampleRefId_43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f",
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="payout" label="Payout">
  ```json
  {
    "source_wallet_id": "1111-1222-2333-33aab-bcc9",
    "requested_amount": {
      "amount": 15500,
      "currency": "GBP"
    },
    "type": "PAYOUT",
    "external_id": "ExampleRefId_43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f",
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Where:

| **Parameter**      | **Description**                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source_wallet_id` | The ID of the default wallet provided by Fondy. This is the wallet from which the transfer will originate.                                |
| `target_wallet_id` | The ID of the wallet to which the transfer will be made. This field is only required for **Transfer** and **Reversal** transaction types. |
| `requested_amount` | An object containing the details of the amount to be transferred.                                                                         |
| `amount`           | The amount to transfer, expressed in pence.                                                                                               |
| `currency`         | The currency for the transaction.                                                                                                         |
| `type`             | The type of transaction.                                                                                                                  |
| `external_id`      | A unique ID provided by you to identify the transaction for your system or external integration.                                          |

Once you create the payload it has to be encrypted, see the following section for more details.

### Step 2: Make the encrypted request

To create a wallet under a split account, follow the steps below:

1. Follow the steps in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to encrypt your request into the stack.
2. Send the encrypted operation using [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted). See an example in the code block below:
   ```json Request
   {
       "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(paymentObject),
       "encrypted_user": ENCRYPTED(<username>),    
       "encrypted_url": ENCRYPTED("/splitaccount/{splitaccount_id}/wallet"),
       "method": "POST"
   }
   ```

In the request `ENCRYPTED(paymentObject)` is the payload previously created, which is now encrypted.

<Callout type="warning" title="Path Parameters">
  Change the following in the `encrypted_url`

  * Change `{splitaccount_id}` with the ID of the split account containing the wallet.
  * Change `{id}`with the ID of the wallet to retrieve.
</Callout>

## Response

A successful request will return the encrypted response, as in the code block below:

```json json
{
    "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(paymentObject),
    "encrypted_url": null,
    "method": null,
    "nonce": null,
}
```

This response has to be decrypted using the process explained in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api). Once it is decrypted, the unencrypted payload is as follows:

```json
{
  "target_wallet_id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
  "additional_information": "Example123",
  "payment_direction": "INBOUND",
  "external_id": "ExampleRefId_43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f",
  "id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
  "source_wallet_id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
  "payment_reference": "Payment to X",
  "type": "TRANSFER",
  "requested_amount": {
    "currency": "GBP",
    "amount": 15500
  },
  "status": "PROCESSING"
}
```

Where:

| **Parameter**            | **Description**                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `additional_information` | Any additional information related to the transaction (e.g., reference numbers or notes).            |
| `payment_direction`      | Indicates whether the payment is inbound or outbound.                                                |
| `id`                     | Unique identifier for the payment transaction.                                                       |
| `payment_reference`      | The payment reference used to identify the transaction, such as a description or internal reference. |
| `status`                 | The current status of the payment.                                                                   |
