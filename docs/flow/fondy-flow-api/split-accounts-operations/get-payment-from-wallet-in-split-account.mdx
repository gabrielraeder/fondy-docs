This operation lets you retrieve the details of a specific payment made from a wallet under a Split Account. You can obtain the payment status, amount, and related information for a transaction identified by its payment ID. This is useful for tracking individual payments, verifying transaction details, or performing reconciliation tasks. This page will guide you through the process of using this operation.

<Callout type="warning" title="Encrypted Requests">
  All requests into the stack are performed using the [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted), where the request and response of the operation are encrypted. See [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to learn how to encrypt your operations and send them through the endpoint.
</Callout>

## Request

To retrieve a payment from a wallet under a split account, follow the steps below:

1. Follow the steps in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to encrypt your request into the stack.
2. Send the encrypted operation using [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted). See an example in the code block below:
   ```json
   {
       "encrypted_payload": null,
       "encrypted_user": ENCRYPTED(<username>),    
       "encrypted_url": ENCRYPTED("/splitaccount/{splitaccount_id}/wallet/{id}/payment/{paymentId}"),
       "method": "GET"
   }
   ```
   
<Callout type="warning" title="Path Parameters">
  Change the following in the `encrypted_url`

  * Change `{splitaccount_id}` with the ID of the split account containing the wallet.
  * Change `{id}`with the ID of the wallet containing the payment.
  * Change `{paymentId}` with the ID of the payment to retrieve.
</Callout>

## Response

A successful request will return the encrypted response, as in the code block below:

```json
{
    "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(paymentObject)
    "encrypted_url": null
    "method": null
}
```

This response has to be decrypted using the process explained in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api). Once decrypted, the payload is as follows:

```json
{
  "target_wallet_id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
  "additional_information": "Example123",
