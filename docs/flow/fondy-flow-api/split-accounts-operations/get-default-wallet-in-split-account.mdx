This operation lets you retrieve the default wallet associated with a specific Split Account. The default wallet is the primary wallet used for transactions in the Split Account.

This page will guide you through the process of using this operation.

<Callout type="warning" title="Encrypted Requests">
  All requests into the stack are performed using the [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted), where the request and response of the operation are encrypted. See [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to learn how to encrypt your operations and send them through the endpoint.
</Callout>

## Request

To retrieve the information of a split account's default wallet, follow the steps below:

1. Follow the steps in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to encrypt your request into the stack.
2. Send the encrypted operation using [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted). See an example in the code block below:
   ```json
   {
       "encrypted_payload": null,
       "encrypted_user": ENCRYPTED(<username>),    
       "encrypted_url": ENCRYPTED("/splitaccount/{splitaccount_id}/defaultwallet"),
       "method": "GET"
   }
   ```

<Callout type="warning" title="Path Parameters">
  Change the following in the `encrypted_url`

  * Change `{splitaccount_id}` with the ID of the split account containing the wallet.
</Callout>

## Response

A successful request will return the encrypted response, as in the code block below:

```json
{
    "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(walletObject)
    "encrypted_url": null
    "method": null
}
```

This response has to be decrypted using the process explained in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api). Once decrypted, the payload is as follows:

```json
{
  "additional_information": "Example123",
  "balances": {
    "current": {
      "currency": "GBP",
      "amount": 4500
    }
  },
  "default_wallet_id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
  "payee_identity_id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
  "payee_details": {
    "name": "string",
    "iban": "FR7630006000011234567890189",
    "sort_code": "012345",
    "bic": "string",
    "account_number": "01234567",
    "id": "string"
  },
  "payee_compliance_profile_id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
  "alias": "Example123",
  "default_payment_reference": "Payment to X",
  "external_id": "ExampleRefId_43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f",
  "id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
  "created_date": "2020-01-22T13:15:30.000Z",
  "status": "ACTIVE"
}
```

The payload information is the same as that in the response of the [Get Wallets in Split Account](/flow/fondy-flow-api/split-accounts-operations/get-wallets-in-split-account) operation.
