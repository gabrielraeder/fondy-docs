This operation allows you to create a new wallet under a specific Split Account. For example, if you're managing multiple wallets for different purposes within the same Split Account, you can create a new wallet with its own unique properties, such as payment references, compliance details, and balance tracking.

This page will guide you through the process of using this operation. See the following sections for more details.

<Callout type="warning" title="Encrypted Requests">
  All requests into the stack are performed using the [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted), where the request and response of the operation are encrypted. See [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to learn how to encrypt your operations and send them through the endpoint.
</Callout>

## Request

The request process of this operation consists of the following two steps:

1. [Create the payload](#step-1-create-the-payload)
2. [Make the encrypted request](#step-2-make-the-encrypted-request)

See the sections below for more details on each step.

### Step 1: Create the payload

The information on the wallet must be sent to the payload. See the code block below for an example:

```json
{
  "default_wallet_id": "Provided by Fondy",
  "identity_id": "a526165d-3f68-45fa-a3bd-87c6ecd5584b",
  "payee_compliance_profile_id": "From the call to onboarding",
  "default_payment_reference": "202408091128",
  "alias": "name/reference for this wallet for yourselves to set",
  "additional_information": "202408091129",
  "payee_details": {
    "name": "name",
    "iban": "iban",
    "currency": "EUR",
    "address": {
      "country_code": "LT",
      "city": "Vilnius",
      "street": "Street",
      "building_name": "Building",
      "building_number": "16B",
      "postal_code": "LT-12345"
    },
    "externalId": "6566c461-957d-4937-b7d5-744c63c8fa66"
  }
}
```

Where:

| **Parameter**                 | **Description**                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `additional_information`      | Field for your reference or additional information. It must be 1-125 characters and match a regex pattern. |
| `balances`                    | An object representing the balance details of the wallet.                                                  |
| `default_wallet_id`           | Unique identifier for the default wallet.                                                                  |
| `payee_details`               | Details about the account, such as IBAN/BIC or sort code/account number.                                   |
| `payee_identity_id`           | Unique identifier for the payee's identity. This is a legacy field.                                        |
| `payee_compliance_profile_id` | Unique identifier for the payee's compliance profile.                                                      |
| `alias`                       | Alias for the Split Account Wallet. It must be 1-35 characters and match a regex pattern.                  |
| `default_payment_reference`   | Reference for payments provided by the payee.                                                              |
| `external_id`                 | Client-supplied external reference for the wallet.                                                         |
| `id`                          | Unique identifier for the account.                                                                         |
| `created_date`                | ISO 8601 formatted DateTime indicating when the wallet was created                                         |

Once you create the payload, it has to be encrypted. See the following section for more details.

### Step 2: Make the encrypted request

To create the wallet, follow the steps below:

1. To encrypt your request in the stack, follow the steps in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) .
2. Send the encrypted operation using [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted). See an example in the code block below:
   ```json Request
    {
        "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(accountObject),
        "encrypted_user": ENCRYPTED(<username>),    
        "encrypted_url": ENCRYPTED("/accounts"),
        "method": "POST"
    }
   ```
   
In the request `ENCRYPTED(accountObject)` is the payload previously created, which is now encrypted.

## Response

A successful request will return the encrypted response, as in the code block below:

```json
{
    "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(accountObject)
    "encrypted_url": null
    "method": null
    "nonce": null
}
```

This response has to be decrypted using the process explained in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api). Once it is decrypted, the unencrypted payload is as follows:

```json
{
  "account_currency": "GBP",
  "account_type": "STANDARD",
  "account_balance": {
    "currency": "GBP",
    "amount": 4500
  },
  "account_details": {
    "name": "string",
    "iban": "FR7630006000011234567890189",
    "sort_code": "012345",
    "bic": "string",
    "account_number": "01234567",
    "id": "string"
  },
  "external_id": "ExampleRefId_43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f",
  "classification": "BUSINESS_OTHER",
  "created_date_time": "2020-01-22T13:15:30.000Z",
  "default_wallet": true,
  "updated_date_time": "2020-01-22T13:15:30.000Z",
  "master_account_id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
  "wallet_account_id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
  "id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
  "wallet_business_reference": "string",
  "account_alias": "Example123",
  "status": "ACTIVE"
}
```

Where `id` is the newly created wallet's ID.
