All interactions with the Fondy API are done through the Encrypted Endpoint. With it, you can perform different operations, such as creating a profile or making a payout. This API mandates encrypting all requests and responses to ensure data security and integrity. This is achieved using a combination of AES and RSA encryption, along with digital signatures. The core workflow is as follows:

1. **Encryption**: Payloads are encrypted using dynamically generated AES keys. These keys are further encrypted with Fondy's RSA public key, ensuring secure transmission.
2. **Digital Signing**: Requests are digitally signed using the client's private key to prevent tampering and to authenticate the sender.
3. **Send Request**: Create the encrypted request object and perform the request to the Encrypted endpoint
4. **Decryption**: Encrypted responses are processed by decrypting the AES key with the client's private RSA key and decrypting the payload using the decrypted AES key.

See more details in the following sections.

## Step 1: Encryption

Before sending the request to the Fondy API, you must encrypt it. Follow the steps below to do so:

1. First, Generate an `AES` key using a cryptographic library that generates a 128-bit `AES` key. This key will later be used to encrypt the request payload.

```java 
  KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
  keyGen.init(128);
  SecretKey aesKey = keyGen.generateKey();
```

2. Encrypt the `AES` key using Fondy's `RSA` public key.

```java
  Cipher rsaCipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA");
  rsaCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, fondyPublicKey);
  byte[] encryptedAESKey = rsaCipher.doFinal(aesKey.getEncoded());
  String base64EncryptedAESKey = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encryptedAESKey);
```

   This ensures Fondy's private key can only be decrypted by the `AES` key.

   <Callout type="info" title="Fondy's RSA Public Key"  >
     The RSA Public Key is provided by Fondy during the onboading.
   </Callout>

3. Encrypt the JSON payload using the `AES` key in `AES cipher` mode.

```java
  Cipher aesCipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
  aesCipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, aesKey);
  byte[] encryptedPayload = aesCipher.doFinal(payload.getBytes());
  String base64EncryptedPayload = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encryptedPayload);
```

4. Combine the Encrypted Components, concatenating the `Base64-encoded AES` key and payload with the delimiter `"-----"`, and `Base64` encode the resulting string.

```java
  String combined = base64EncryptedAESKey + "-----" + base64EncryptedPayload;
  String finalEncryptedRequest = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(combined.getBytes());
```

## Step 2: Digital Signing

Create a digital signature using your private RSA key to ensure data integrity and authenticity. Combine the following Base64-encoded components:

* `encrypted_url`
* `method` (not Base64-encoded)
* `encrypted_payload`
* `encrypted_user`

Then, sign the combined string using your private `RSA` key and the `SHA256WithRSA` algorithm. See the code block below for an example:

```java
  String stringToSign = encObject.encrypted_url + encObject.method + encObject.encrypted_payload + encObject.encrypted_user;

          Signature sig = Signature.getInstance("SHA256WithRSA");
          sig.initSign(getPrivateKey());
          sig.update(stringToSign.getBytes());
          byte[] signature = sig.sign();

          return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(signature);
```

## Step 3: Send Request

First, build the encrypted request object to send the operation request to the Fondy API. See the code block below to see how it is formatted:

```json
{
    "encrypted_payload": "BASE64_ENCRYPTED_PAYLOAD",
    "encrypted_url": "BASE64_ENCRYPTED_URL",
    "encrypted_user": "BASE64_ENCRYPTED_USER",
    "method": "POST",
      "signature": "BASE64_SIGNATURE"
}
```

Once your encrypted object is created, the request is sent as a POST request to the Encrypted endpoint. The following code block provides an example of a request in a Java application.

```java
  WebClient webClient = WebClient.create("https://api.fondyflow.io");

  EncryptedObject encryptedRequest = buildEncryptedRequest(payload, url, "POST", user);

  EncryptedObject response = webClient.post()
      .url("/clientapi/encrypted/v1/{clientRef}")
      .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
      .body(Mono.just(encryptedRequest), EncryptedObject.class)
      .retrieve()
      .bodyToMono(EncryptedObject.class)
      .block();
```

<Callout type="info" title="Path Parameters" >
  Change `{clientRef}` with the actual client reference number.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Decryption

Once you complete the request, the response will be encrypted. See an example in nthe code block below:

```json
  {
      "encrypted_payload": encrypted_payload,
      "encrypted_url": null,
      "method": null,
      "nonce": null
  }
```

To decrypt a response, follow the steps below:

1. `Base64` decode the encrypted\_payload.
2. Split the string into `AES` key and payload.
3. Decrypt the `AES` key using the private `RSA` key.
4. Decrypt the payload using the `AES` key.
5. Convert the decrypted payload to a readable string.

The code block below exemplifies this process in a Java application.

```java
private static String decodeString(String encryptedPayload) throws Exception {
    // Step 1: Base64 decode the encrypted_payload
    String decoded = new String(Base64.getDecoder().decode(encryptedPayload));

    // Step 2: Split the string into AES key and payload
    String[] parts = decoded.split(DELIMITER);
    byte[] rsaEncryptedAESKey = Base64.getDecoder().decode(parts[0]);
    byte[] aesEncryptedPayload = Base64.getDecoder().decode(parts[1]);

    // Step 3: Decrypt the AES key using the private RSA key
    Cipher rsaCipher = Cipher.getInstance("RSA");
    rsaCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, getPrivateKey());
    byte[] aesKeyBytes = rsaCipher.doFinal(rsaEncryptedAESKey);
    SecretKeySpec aesKey = new SecretKeySpec(aesKeyBytes, "AES");

    // Step 4: Decrypt the payload using the AES key
    Cipher aesCipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
    aesCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, aesKey);
    byte[] decryptedBytes = aesCipher.doFinal(aesEncryptedPayload);

    // Step 5: Convert the decrypted payload to a readable string
    return new String(decryptedBytes);
}
```
