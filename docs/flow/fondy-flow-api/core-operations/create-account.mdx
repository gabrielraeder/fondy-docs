This API Operation allows you to create a specific account in the Fondy system. Accounts can be of three types:

* Standard
* Master
* Wallet

This page will guide you through using this operation. See the following sections for more details.

<Callout type="warning" title="Encrypted Requests">
  All requests into the stack are performed using the [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted), where the request and response of the operation are encrypted. See [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to learn how to encrypt your operations and send them through the endpoint.
</Callout>

## Request

The request process of this operation consists of the following two steps:

1. Create the payload
2. Make the encrypted request

See the sections below for more details on each step.

### Step 1: Create the payload

The information on the account must be sent to the payload. See the code block below for an example:

```json
{
  "default_wallet_id": "Provided by Fondy",
  "identity_id": "a526165d-3f68-45fa-a3bd-87c6ecd5584b",
  "payee_compliance_profile_id": "From the call to onboarding",
  "default_payment_reference": "202408091128",
  "alias": "name/reference for this wallet for yourselves to set",
  "additional_information": "202408091129",
  "payee_details": {
    "name": "name",
    "iban": "iban",
    "currency": "EUR",
    "address": {
      "country_code": "LT",
      "city": "Vilnius",
      "street": "Street",
      "building_name": "Building",
      "building_number": "16B",
      "postal_code": "LT-12345"

  }
}
```

Where:

Once you create the payload, it has to be encrypted. See the following section for more details.

### Step 2: Make the encrypted request

To create the Fondy account, follow the steps below:

1. Follow the steps in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to encrypt your request into the stack.
2. Send the encrypted operation using [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted). See an example in the code block below:

  ```json
    {
         "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(walletObject),
         "encrypted_user": ENCRYPTED(<username>),    
         "encrypted_url": ENCRYPTED("/account"),
         "method": "POST"
    }
  ```

In the request `ENCRYPTED(walletObject)` is the payload previously created, which is now encrypted.

## Response

A successful request will return the encrypted response, as in the code block below:

```json
{
    "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(accountObject)
    "encrypted_url": null
    "method": null
    "nonce": null
}
```

This response has to be decrypted using the process explained in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api). Once it is decrypted, the unencrypted payload is as follows:

```json
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.fondy.io/clientapi/api/version/clientRef/base64user/accounts \
     --header 'accept: */*' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "account_type": "MASTER",
  "account_currency": "GBP",
  "account_balance": {
    "currency": "GBP",
    "amount": 4500
  },

    "sort_code": "012345",
    "account_number": "01234567"
  },
  "external_id": "ExampleRefId_43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f",
  "classification": "SOLE_TRADER",
  "created_date_time": "2020-01-22T13:15:30.000Z",
  "updated_date_time": "2020-01-22T13:15:30.000Z",
  "master_account_id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
  "id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
  "wallet_account_id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
  "account_alias": "Example123",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "default_wallet": true
}
'
