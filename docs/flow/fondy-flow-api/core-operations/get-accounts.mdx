The Get Accounts operation lets you retrieve a list of accounts associated with a specific client or a particular account by its ID.

This page will guide you through the process of using the operations:

* [Retrieve All Accounts](#retrieve-all-accounts)
* [Retrieve Specific Account](#retrieve-specific-account)

The following sections will describe them in more detail.

<Callout type="warning" title="Encrypted Requests">
  All requests into the stack are performed using the [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted), where the request and response of the operation are encrypted. See [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to learn how to encrypt your operations and send them through the endpoint.
</Callout>

## Retrieve All Accounts

To retrieve a list of all accounts under, follow the steps below:

1. Follow the steps in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to learn how to encrypt your request into the stack.
2. Send the encrypted operation using [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted). See an example in the code block below:
   ```json
    {
        "encrypted_payload": null,
        "encrypted_user": ENCRYPTED(<username>),    
        "encrypted_url": ENCRYPTED("/accounts"),
        "method": "GET"
    }
   ```

### Response

A successful request will return the encrypted response, as in the code block below:

```json
{
    "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(accounts)
    "encrypted_url": null
    "method": null
}
```

This response has to be decrypted using the process explained in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api). Once you decrypt it, the unencrypted payload will return an array of account objects, like the one in the example below:

```json
[
  {
    "account_currency": "GBP",
      "account_type": "STANDARD",
      "account_balance": {
        "currency": "GBP",
        "amount": 4500
      },
      "account_details": {
        "name": "string",
        "iban": "FR7630006000011234567890189",
        "sort_code": "012345",
        "bic": "string",
        "account_number": "01234567",
        "id": "string"
      },
      "external_id": "ExampleRefId_43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f",
      "classification": "BUSINESS_OTHER",
      "created_date_time": "2020-01-22T13:15:30.000Z",
      "default_wallet": true,
      "updated_date_time": "2020-01-22T13:15:30.000Z",
      "master_account_id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
      "wallet_account_id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
      "id": "f8605015-90ac-4450-bb99-cbb1591bce7a",
      "wallet_business_reference": "string",
      "account_alias": "Example123",
    "status": "ACTIVE"
  }
]
```

The parameters are the same as described in the [Create Account](/flow/fondy-flow-api/core-operations/create-account) operation.

## Retrieve Specific Account

To retrieve information about a specific account, follow the steps below:

1. Follow the steps in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to encrypt your request in the stack.
2. Send the encrypted operation using [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted). See an example in the code block below:
   ```json
    {
        "encrypted_payload": null,
        "encrypted_user": ENCRYPTED(<username>),    
        "encrypted_url": ENCRYPTED("/accounts/{accountId}"),
        "method": "GET"
     }
   ```

<Callout type="warning" title="Path Parameters">
  Change the `{accountId}` with the ID of the account you wish to retrieve in the `encrypted_url` field.
</Callout>

### Response

A successful request will return the encrypted response, as in the code block below:

```json
{
    "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(account)
    "encrypted_url": null
    "method": null
}
```

This response has to be decrypted using the process explained in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api). Once you decrypt it, the unencrypted payload is as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "account_currency": "GBP",
      "account_type": "STANDARD",
      "account_balance": {
        "currency": "GBP",
        "amount": 4500
      },
      "account_details": {
        "name": "string",

        "account_number": "01234567",
        "id": "string"
      },
      "external_id": "ExampleRefId_43971e26-61b1-420b-9add-c510d44a354f",
