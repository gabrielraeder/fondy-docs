The Create Payment operation allows you to initiate an outbound payment from a Fondy account to a counterparty. This operation requires the provision of counterparty details, the payment amount, a payment reference, and the payment type (currently, only `fasterpayments` and `internal` are supported). Additionally, the account details for the payee or counterparty must be provided.

This page will guide you through using this operation. See the following sections for more details.

<Callout type="warning" title="Encrypted Requests">
  All requests into the stack are performed using the [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted), where the request and response of the operation are encrypted. See [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to learn how to encrypt your operations and send them through the endpoint.
</Callout>

## Request

The request process of this operation consists of the following two steps:

1. [Create the payload](#create-the-payload)
2. [Make the encrypted request](#make-the-encrypted-request)

See the sections below for more details on each step.

### Step 1: Create the payload

The information on the account must be sent to the payload. See the code block below for an example:

```json
{
  "counterparty": {
      "account_number": 12345678,
      "name": "ExampleCounterparty",
      "sort_code": 35648,
      "bic": 35648,
      "iban": "12312312",
      "address": {
        "country_code": "England",
        "city": "London",
        "street": "Street",
        "building_name": "1",
        "building_number": "2",
        "postal_code": "11223"
      }
    },
    "requested_amount": {
      "currency": "GBP",
      "amount": 99
    },
    "payment_references": {
      "payment_reference": "11122223333"
    }
  }
  '
```

Once you create the payload, it has to be encrypted. See the following section for more details.

### Step 2: Make the encrypted request

To create the Fondy account, follow the steps below:

1. Follow the steps in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to encrypt your request into the stack.
2. Send the encrypted operation using [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted). See an example in the code block below:
   ```json
     {
         "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(walletObject),
         "encrypted_user": ENCRYPTED(<username>),    
         "encrypted_url": ENCRYPTED("/account"),
         "method": "POST"
     }
   ```

In the request `ENCRYPTED(walletObject)` is the payload previously created, which is now encrypted.

## Response

A successful request will return the encrypted response, as in the code block below:

```json
{
    "encrypted_payload": ENCRYPTED(accountObject)
    "encrypted_url": null
    "method": null
    "nonce": null
}
```

This response has to be decrypted using the process explained in [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api). Once it is decrypted, the unencrypted payload is as follows:
  
```json
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.fondy.io/clientapi/api/version/clientRef/base64user/accounts \
     --header 'accept: */*' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '

  },

  "account_alias": "Example123",
  "status": "ACTIVE",

}
