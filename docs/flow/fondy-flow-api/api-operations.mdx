The Fondy API provides a comprehensive suite of operations for managing accounts, payments, transactions, compliance, and split account operations. It is designed to handle core and specialized workflows while maintaining security and scalability.

All requests to the Fondy API are performed using the [Encrypted Endpoint](/reference/flow/encrypted), which must be encrypted beforehand. See [How to Integrate Fondy API](/flow/fondy-flow-api/how-to-integrate-fondy-api) to learn how to encrypt your operations and send them through the endpoint.

## Available Operations

The API operations are grouped into the following categories to help you easily locate and implement the functionality you need:

* [Core Operations](/flow/fondy-flow-api/core-operations/core-operations): Core operations are the fundamental actions available in the API. These include account management and payment handling.
* [Split Accounts](/flow/fondy-flow-api/split-accounts-operations/split-accounts-operations): The Split Accounts operations provide a powerful way to manage multiple wallets and their transactions within a single account structure
* [Identity Operations](/flow/fondy-flow-api/identity/identity): These operations allow you to create, retrieve, and manage client identity profiles.
* [Compliance Operations](/flow/fondy-flow-api/compliance/compliance): You can create and manage compliance-related identity profiles.
