Wallets are components of the Fondy Flow solution that enable platforms to manage funds for their partners, such as merchants, sellers, or freelancers. After onboarding your partner, you can create a wallet for them to handle transactions.

<Callout type="info" title="Onboarding Process">
  Access the [Create Split Account](/flow/accounts/split-accounts/creating-a-split-account) and [Onboarding and Managing Profiles](/flow/accounts/split-accounts/managing-profiles) pages to learn more about the onboarding process.
</Callout>

With this solution, you can assign wallets to partners to streamline payment splitting and payouts. The created wallets are directly tied to a partner's profile and bank account, ensuring accurate fund allocation. In addition, you can monitor and manage the wallets using the API.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a wallet, ensure the following data is available:

* **Platform Wallet ID**: The default wallet ID associated with your platform.
* **Partner's Profile ID**: The unique identifier for the partner you create the wallet for.
* **Partner's Payee Bank Account**: The bank account where funds from the wallet will be transferred.
* **Default Payment Reference**: A description to be included with all wallet payments (if not otherwise specified during transactions).

## Creating a Wallet

To create a new wallet, submit the required details as outlined in the **Requirements** section. Access the [Create Wallet Under the Split Account](link) guide for complete API specifications, including detailed request and response examples.

Upon successful creation, the wallet will be assigned the status:

* **Active**: The wallet is ready for transactions.

Wallets have only two possible statuses:

* **Active**: The wallet is open, operational, and ready for transactions.
* **Closed**: The wallet has been deactivated and cannot be used for any transactions.
