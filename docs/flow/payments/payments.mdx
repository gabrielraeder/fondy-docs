The **Payments** feature enables users to initiate, track, and manage financial transactions. Using the **Create Payments** endpoint, you can transfer funds between an account and a designated counterparty.

Following these guidelines, you can efficiently initiate and manage payments while maintaining complete control over your financial transactions. For more details on payment setup, refer to the [API Reference](/reference/introduction_flow).

## Create Payments

The **Create a Payment** operation allows users to move funds from a specified account (**account\_id**) to a counterparty (the beneficiary receiving the funds). It is ideal for processing customer transactions, vendor payments, internal transfers, or payroll payments.

### Operation Details

The [Create Payments](/flow/fondy-flow-api/core-operations/create-payments) operation facilitates the creation of new payments within the system, such as vendor payments or customer transactions.

## Payment Status

Payments go through various statuses, which provide insights into their progress:

1. **Processing**: The initial status after submitting a payment request. Indicates the system validates payment details and checks the account balance (including fees).

2. **Settled**: Payment has been successfully sent to the counterparty.

3. **Rejected**: Payment could not be processed. Use the **View Payment Details** endpoint to determine the reason for the rejection. Common rejection reasons are:

   * Insufficient funds;
   * Incorrect or missing payment details.

  You can check payment status at any time within the system. Webhooks are not currently supported for status updates.
</Callout>

## Payment Fees

Payment fees are calculated based on the settlement scheme, which depends on the counterparty's country and currency.

### Key Details:

* The **Create Payment** endpoint response includes the fee amount, currency, and payment\_id.
* Ensure the account balance covers both the payment amount and associated fees.
* Insufficient funds will result in a rejected payment with an **'Insufficient funds'** message.

## Account Entries

Account balances are affected by the success or failure of a payment. The system creates a transaction entry for each debit or credit to the account. The table below explains how different payment flows impact account balances:

| **Payment Status** | **Error**          | **Debit/Credit Account Entries**                                                                                                                                                              |
