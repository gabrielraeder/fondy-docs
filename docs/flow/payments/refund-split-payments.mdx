Fondy Flow also allows refunds for split payments. This feature reverses or adjusts transactions made within the split account structure, transferring Funds from the Wallet back to the Master Account.

## How to Refund a Split Payment

This process uses the [Create Split Payment](/flow/fondy-flow-api/split-accounts-operations/create-split-payment) operation through the Fondy API. In the payload of the request, it is essential to use the `REVERSAL` payment type. See the code block below for an example:

```json
  {   "source_wallet_id: The wallet to send the reversal from,
      "target_wallet_id: default_wallet_id we have provided,
      "requested_amount: {
         "amount: amount in pence (e.g. 1000 = Â£10)
         "currency: GBP must be GBP
      },
      "type: REVERSAL
      "external_id": Unique ID from you,
  }
  ```

As you can see, the `type` parameter is set to`REVERSAL`. You also need to provide the following parameters:

* `source_wallet_id`: The ID of the wallet from where the reversal is being made.
* `target_wallet_id`: The ID of the default wallet of the account to send funds back.
