## Features and Functionalities

Below is an overview of the key features and functionalities, as highlighted in the dashboard:

1. **Home**: The Home screen is the dashboard's starting point, providing a comprehensive overview of your financial activities. It displays an **All accounts summary**, an **All accounts overview**, a **Money in/out** graph that visualizes your incoming and outgoing funds, and an **Accounts balances** graph to track balances over time.
2. **Accounts**: The Accounts section allows you to manage and view all your accounts, including their type, status, currency, and balance. It also provides the functionality to create new accounts, making it easier to expand your financial operations.
3. **Payments**: In the Payments section, you can review all payment transactions, including details such as the date, the account paid from, the account paid to, a description, the amount, and the status. The interface also allows you to filter payments by date or status for better organization. Additionally, you can initiate new payments directly from this section.
4. **Counterparties**: The Counterparties section lets you view and manage your system's registered counterparties, including their details and currencies. You can edit existing counterparties, delete them, or add new ones as needed.
5. **Merchants**: In the Merchants section, you can view merchant settlement details, including the date, settlement ID, currency, and amount. This feature provides transparency and helps you keep track of all settlement activities.
6. **Split Account**: The Split Account section offers a summary and management options for split accounts. It includes an overview of account activity, transaction history, linked wallets, and associated user profiles, helping you stay in control of all aspects of your split accounts.
7. **Make a Payment**: The **Make a Payment** option allows you to initiate a new transaction to a counterparty or as a transfer between accounts. Select the account from which to send funds and complete the payment details to process the transaction quickly.
8. **Create New Account**: Using the **Create New Account** button, you can start adding a new account. Enter the account name and currency, and the request will be sent to Fondy's team for creation. This ensures a smooth setup for expanding your financial infrastructure.
