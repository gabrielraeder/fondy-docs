## Core Components of a Split Account

A Split Account is a collection of wallets, each serving specific purposes within a platform. Below are the main account types:

* **Split Account**: The primary account includes all wallets linked to the platform and its associated profiles. it's identified by the `splitaccount_id`.
* **Platform/Marketplace Wallet Account**: It's also called **default wallet**. This wallet collects funds from all successful transactions. It is uniquely identified by the `default_wallet_id`.
* **Partner Wallet Account**: These wallets hold and distribute funds to merchants, partners, or sellers. Each wallet has a unique `wallet_id`.

## How Split Accounts Works

The basic steps to use the Split Accounts functionalities are the following:

1. **Create Split Rules**: Define the percentage or fixed amount each recipient should receive from a transaction.

2. **Assign Recipients**: Specify the accounts to which the funds will be distributed.

3. **Process Payment**: When a payment is received, the funds are automatically split according to the predefined rules and transferred to the appropriate wallets.

After setting up the Split Account configurations, the funds flow after receiving the payment from a provider will follow these steps:

1. The payments are received from a payment provider and deposited into the Platform/Marketplace Wallet (Default Wallet).
2. A portion of the funds can be designated as the platform's commission, which is transferred from the Default Wallet to an IBAN operational account for further business operations or costs.
   1. Platform or marketplace costs can also be deducted from the IBAN operational account and allocated to a designated costs account.
3. The remaining funds are distributed to Partner Wallets based on predefined split rules.
4. Funds in the Partner Wallets are transferred to the respective partners' bank accounts based on the payout schedule or business criteria.

The following diagram summarizes the process.
