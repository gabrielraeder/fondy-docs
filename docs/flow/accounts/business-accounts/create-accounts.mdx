Setting up new accounts with Fondy using the **Create Accounts** endpoint is straightforward. Newly created accounts will initially have a **'Pending'** status until approved. Once approved, the status will change to **'Active'**.

By following these guidelines, you can efficiently create new business accounts, ensuring a seamless onboarding experience and quick access to Fondy's services. For API-specific parameters and sample request/response formats, refer to the [Create Account API documentation](link).

## Step 1: Initiate the Account Creation

Use the **Create Accounts** endpoint to begin the process. Ensure all required fields are accurately completed, including:

* Business name
* Contact information
* Additional necessary details specific to your account type

## Step 2: Account Status 'Pending'

Upon submitting the account creation request, the new account will automatically enter a **'Pending'** status. This status indicates the account information is under review and awaiting approval.

## Step 3: Review and Approval Process

During the **'Pending'** phase:

* The submitted information is reviewed for accuracy and compliance.
* Additional documentation or details may be requested to complete the verification process.

## Step 4: Status Updates to 'Active'

After a successful review, the account transitions to **'Active'** status. An **'Active'** status enables full access to all features and services.

## Step 5: Notifications and Communication

Notifications will be sent at key stages of the process:

* When the account enters the **'Pending'** status
* Once the account is approved and becomes **'Active'**

Any additional documentation requests or rejection details will be communicated via the following:

* Email
* The account dashboard
