The PHP SDK for Fondy Gateway simplifies payment processing integration into your PHP applications. It provides an easy-to-use interface for managing payments, including checkout flows, supporting multiple currencies, and payment methods. The SDK allows developers to quickly set up and process transactions through Fondy Gateway's payment solution.

## Requirements

Before you start using the PHP SDK, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

* PHP version 7.2 or higher.
* Composer (for easy dependency management). For more information on setting up Composer, visit [Composer's Installation Guide](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).
* An active merchant account with Fondy Gateway.

## Installation

You can install the SDK into your project using Composer or manually.

### Using Composer

Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP. To install the Fondy Gateway PHP SDK via Composer, run the following command in your project's root directory:


  ```bash bash
  composer require cloudipsp/php-sdk-v2
  ```


### Manual Installation

Alternatively, you can manually install the SDK by cloning the repository:


  ```bash bash
  git clone -b master https://github.com/cloudipsp/php-sdk-v2.git
  ```


Once cloned, include the SDK in your project by adding the following line to your PHP script:


  ```php php
  <?php
  require '/<path-to-sdk>/autoload.php';
  ```


Replace the `path-to-sdk`, indicating where the SDK is available in your machine.

## How to Use the SDK

To start using the SDK, you need to configure it with your merchant ID and secret key. This will authenticate your requests to Fondy Gateway.


  ```php php
  require 'vendor/autoload.php';

  // Set your merchant ID and secret key
  \Cloudipsp\Configuration::setMerchantId(1396424);
  \Cloudipsp\Configuration::setSecretKey('your-secret-key');
  ```


Once the SDK is set up, you can generate a checkout URL to process payments. The following example demonstrates how to create a simple checkout request:


  ```php php
  $checkoutData = [
      'currency' => 'USD', // Set the currency for the transaction
      'amount' => 1000,     // Amount in smallest units (e.g., cents)
  ];

  $data = \Cloudipsp\Checkout::url($checkoutData);
  $url = $data->getUrl();  // Get the URL to redirect the user for payment

  // To redirect the user to the payment page:
  header('Location: ' . $url);
  exit;
  ```


This code snippet creates a checkout URL that the user can visit to complete the payment.

## Usage Examples

Fondy provides a group of examples you can run on your machine to have a better understanding of how to use the PHP SDK. For testing purposes, you can run the SDK examples using PHP's built-in web server. Navigate to the directory where you installed the SDK and run:


  ```bash bash
  cd ~/php-sdk-v2
  php -S localhost:8000
  ```


You can then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to test the examples.
