The Fondy Gateway iOS SDK provides a simple and secure way to integrate Fondy's payment processing capabilities into your iOS applications. The SDK supports Objective-C and Swift, allowing you to easily manage payments, retrieve transaction details, and handle payment workflows within your iOS app.

## Requirements

Before using the SDK, ensure your environment meets the following prerequisites:

* **Xcode version:** 12.0 or later.
* **iOS version:** 11.0 or later.
* **CocoaPods:** Required for installing dependencies (if using CocoaPods).
* **Swift Package Manager:** Alternative method for installation.
* **Swift:** Swift 5.0 or later (if using Swift).

## Installation

The iOS SDK can be integrated into your project using two methods:

* **CocoaPods**
* **Swift Package Manager**

Both methods ensure you get the latest version of the SDK and its dependencies.

### Installation with CocoaPods

To integrate the iOS SDK using CocoaPods, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have CocoaPods installed. If not, install it by running:

   
     ```bash 
     sudo gem install cocoapods
     ```
   

2. Add the following line to your `Podfile`:

   
     ```ruby 
     pod 'Cloudipsp', '~> 0.9.3'
     ```
  

3. Run the following command in your terminal to install the pod:

  
     ```bash 
     pod install
     ```
  

4. Open the `.xcworkspace` file to start using the SDK in your project.

### Installation with Swift Package Manager

If you prefer to use Swift Package Manager, follow these steps:

1. Open your Xcode project and navigate to **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency**.

2. Enter the following GitHub repository URL:

     ```plaintext plaintext
     https://github.com/cloudipsp/ios-sdk.git
     ```

3. Select the version you want to integrate (`0.9.3`).

4. Add the package to your project, and you can use the SDK.

## How to Use the SDK

First, import the SDK in your application file:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="objectivec" label="Objective-C" default>
    ```objectivec
    #import <Cloudipsp/Cloudipsp.h>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="swift" label="Swift">
    ```swift
    import Cloudipsp
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Set the necessary merchant credentials to initialize the SDK. Your **Merchant ID** and **Secret Key** can be found in your Fondy Dashboard.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="objectivec" label="Objective-C" default>
    ```objectivec
    [Cloudipsp setMerchantId:@"Your_Merchant_ID"];
    [Cloudipsp setSecretKey:@"Your_Secret_Key"];
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="swift" label="Swift">
    ```swift
    Cloudipsp.setMerchantId("Your_Merchant_ID")
    Cloudipsp.setSecretKey("Your_Secret_Key")
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the SDK is initialized, you can create a payment request. The following code block presents an example of how to create a payment for a purchase.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="objectivec" label="Objective-C" default>
    ```objectivec
    CloudipspCheckoutRequest *request = [CloudipspCheckoutRequest new];
    request.orderId = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@", @([[NSDate date] timeIntervalSince1970])];
    request.amount = @1000;  // Amount in minor units (e.g., 1000 = 10.00)
    request.currency = @"USD";
    request.orderDescription = @"Test Payment";

    // Perform the request
    [Cloudipsp startPayment:request success:^(CloudipspCheckoutResponse *response) {
        if (response.error == nil) {
            // Handle successful payment response
            NSLog(@"Payment successful. Checkout URL: %@", response.checkoutUrl);
        } else {
            // Handle error
            NSLog(@"Error: %@", response.error.message);
        }
    } failure:^(NSError *error) {
        // Handle request failure
        NSLog(@"Error: %@", error.localizedDescription);
    }];
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="swift" label="Swift">
    ```swift
    let request = CloudipspCheckoutRequest()
    request.orderId = "\(Int(Date().timeIntervalSince1970))"
    request.amount = 1000  // Amount in minor units (e.g., 1000 = 10.00)
    request.currency = "USD"
    request.orderDescription = "Test Payment"

    // Perform the request
    Cloudipsp.startPayment(request, success: { response in
        if let response = response, response.error == nil {
            // Handle successful payment response
            print("Payment successful. Checkout URL: \(response.checkoutUrl)")
        } else {
            // Handle error
            print("Error: \(response?.error?.message ?? "Unknown error")")
        }
    }, failure: { error in
        // Handle request failure
        print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    })
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage Examples

The iOS SDK provides two example projects, one for **Objective-C** and one for **Swift**, to demonstrate how to integrate payment processing into your app. Both examples provide a simple checkout flow where users can initiate a payment, redirect to the payment gateway, and handle the payment response. You can modify these examples to suit your app's specific requirements.

For more information on callbacks and handling payment status, refer to the [Callbacks documentation](/docs/gateway/direct-integration/callbacks.mdx).

### Objective-C Example

To run the Objective-C example:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `Example` directory for Objective-C.
3. Run `pod install` to install the dependencies.
4. Open the `Example.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.
5. Build and run the project.

### Swift Example

To run the Swift example:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `ExampleSwift` directory for Swift.
3. Run `pod install` to install the dependencies.
4. Open the `ExampleSwift.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.
