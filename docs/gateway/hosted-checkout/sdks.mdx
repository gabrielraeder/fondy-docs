Fondy Payments provides a range of Software Development Kits (SDKs) designed to simplify payment solution integration across different platforms. These SDKs offer developers the tools to incorporate secure and efficient payment features into applications and websites.

## What are SDKs?

A Software Development Kit (SDK) is a collection of tools, libraries, code samples, and APIs that help developers build applications for specific platforms or integrate key features. SDKs streamline the development process by providing pre-configured components and reusable functions, saving time and ensuring consistent application functionality.

## Integrations

Fondy offers SDKs for mobile, frontend, and backend applications, enabling businesses to add secure, adaptable payment processing across various platforms.

* **Mobile SDKs**: Fondy's mobile SDKs support in-app payments on iOS and Android. They are optimized to handle secure data processing, including tokenization and recurring payments, and support primary payment methods, such as Visa, MasterCard, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.
