Integrating Google Pay into your mobile application provides users with a seamless and secure payment experience. This section covers the steps to integrate Google Pay with your mobile app, whether you're developing in Java (Android) or React Native.

## Google Pay Mobile Application Approval

Follow these steps to integrate Google Pay into your mobile application using the Fondy SDK and ensure your application meets the requirements for production approval.

1. Log in to the **[Fondy Merchant Portal](https://portal.fondy.eu/mportal/?_gl=1*1drpmkv*_gcl_au*MTgwOTQzNjU3Ny4xNzMyMTEwNTI3LjE1MTM2NTAzMDAuMTczMjEzNDg3MC4xNzMyMTM1Mzc5*_ga*MTM3Mjg4OTIxMS4xNzMyMTEwNTI3*_ga_Z2KY5VSWGZ*MTczMjczOTMxMi4xMC4wLjE3MzI3MzkzMTIuNjAuMC4w#/)**.
2. Register your merchant account and contact **Fondy Support** to enable Google Pay for your account.
3. Fondy will provide you with a **merchant ID** in test mode.
4. Use the Fondy SDK to build your app with the test mode merchant ID.
5. Using the ENVIRONMENT\_TEST mode, configure the Fondy SDK with the following settings:
   
     ```javascript
     gatewayMerchantId: <your FONDY merchant_id>
     gatewayID: fondyeu
     ```
6. Follow Google's [instructions for requesting production access](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/test-and-deploy/request-prod-access).
7. Google will review your integration based on its checklist and may provide recommendations if changes are required.
8. Once all requirements are met, Google will grant production access for your application.
9. Request **Fondy Support** to switch your merchant ID to **LIVE** with ENVIRONMENT\_PRODUCTION mode.
10. Submit your production APK to Google, ensuring it points to the **LIVE** merchant ID.
11. Google will review your application for final approval.

By completing these steps, your mobile application will be ready to process Google Pay transactions in the live environment.
