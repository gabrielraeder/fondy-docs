Integrating Apple Pay into a website can be achieved through two main methods:

* [Embedded Apple Pay Button Integration](#embedded-apple-pay-button-integration): Embed the Apple Pay button directly into your website for a seamless user experience.
* [Direct Integration with Apple Pay API](#direct-integration-with-apple-pay-api): Implement the Apple Pay API to control the payment flow completely.

The embedded method requires integration with Fondy's API or SDK, offering a straightforward implementation with minimal complexity.

In contrast, the direct integration method involves additional steps, such as managing Apple certificates and handling encryption/decryption processes. This method also varies based on the payment flow, depending on whether a tokenized Primary Account Number (DPAN) or an encrypted payment container is used. While more complex, direct integration provides greater flexibility and customization options.

## Embedded Apple Pay Button Integration

The embedded Apple Pay button offers a seamless checkout experience directly on the merchant's website, eliminating the need for users to navigate away. This approach can significantly improve the conversion rate by streamlining the payment process.

The Apple Pay button can be customized to align with your website's look and feel, creating a cohesive brand experience. Additionally, this integration provides merchants with greater control over the checkout process and design, allowing for a tailored user journey.

### Domain Verification for Apple Pay Integration

To integrate the Apple Pay button with Fondy, you must verify all web domains where the button will be displayed. This includes top-level domains (e.g., site.com) and subdomains (e.g., shop.site.com, www\.site.com) for production and development environments.

1. Contact Fondy support to obtain the `apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association.txt` file.
2. Upload the file to the following location on your domain or subdomain: https://example.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association

<Callout type="warning" title="Use Your Domain">
  Replace `example.com` with the appropriate domain or subdomain for your site.
</Callout>

3. Notify Fondy to activate your domain with Apple.

Once the domain verification is complete, your embedded Apple Pay button will be ready to process payments securely and efficiently.

## Direct Integration with Apple Pay API

This guide explains how to integrate directly with the Apple Pay API using decrypted card tokens.

### Step 1: Configure Your Apple Pay Environment

1. Set up your Apple Merchant ID in your Apple Developer account. Follow instructions presented on the [Apple Developer's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/configuring_your_environment).
2. Register your web domain with Apple and verify it.

### Step 2: Integrate Apple Payment Request API

1. Integrate Apple Payment Request API by following [Apple's Payment Request API documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/payment_request_api).
2. Add Apple Pay buttons to your website following [Apple's Display Pay Button documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/displaying_apple_pay_buttons_using_css).
3. Create a `PaymentRequest` object with the required parameters following [Apple's guide](https://webkit.org/blog/8182/introducing-the-payment-request-api-for-apple-pay/). Here is an example configuration:

```
const applePayMethod = {
  supportedMethods: "https://apple.com/apple-pay",
  data: {
      version: 3,
      merchantIdentifier: "merchant.com.example",
      merchantCapabilities: ["supports3DS", "supportsCredit", "supportsDebit"],
      supportedNetworks: ["masterCard", "visa"],
      countryCode: "GE",
  },
};
```

<Callout type="info" title="Don't Forget to Replace">
  Replace `merchant.com.example` with your **Apple Merchant ID** configured in [Step 1.](#step-1-configure-your-apple-pay-environment)
</Callout>

### Step 3: Acquire a Payment Session

Perform [merchant validation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/apple_pay_js_api/providing_merchant_validation) to acquire a payment session from Apple.

<Callout type="warning" title="Back-End Server">
  This step must be executed on your back-end server for security reasons, unlike the other steps, which are front-end-based.
</Callout>

### Step 4: Handle Payment Authorization

Handle the authorization response returned by Apple Pay, ensuring proper validation of the payment data.

### Step 5: Obtain Payment Response

Retrieve the PaymentResponse and the associated [ApplePayPayment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/applepaypayment) dictionary, which contains the tokenized payment data.

### Step 6: Extract Token

Extract the [payment token](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit_apple_pay_and_wallet/pkpayment/1619239-token) from the ApplePayPayment dictionary for decryption.

### Step 7: Decrypt Payment Data

Decrypt the [`paymentData`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/passkit_apple_pay_and_wallet/apple_pay/payment_token_format_reference) field from the payment token to retrieve card details. The decrypted data should be in the following format:

```
{
  "applicationPrimaryAccountNumber": "",
  "applicationExpirationDate": "",
  "currencyCode": "",
  "transactionAmount": ,
  "deviceManufacturerIdentifier": "",
  "paymentDataType": "",
  "paymentData": {
    "onlinePaymentCryptogram": ""
  }
}
```

### Step 8: Send Parameters to Fondy Gateway API

Using the decrypted data, construct a payment request to the [Enroll Card in 3DSecure Service endpoint](/reference/gateway/enroll-card-3-ds) with the following mapping:

`applicationPrimaryAccountNumber` → `card_number`

`applicationExpirationDate` → `expiry_date`

`onlinePaymentCryptogram` → `cavv`

Add `wallet` = `applepay` to indicate the payment method.

Below, you can find an example of how that request should be formatted:

```
{
  "request": {
    "order_id": "Order_id123",
    "merchant_id": 1549901,
    "order_desc": "Apple Pay Payment with card token",
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "GEL",
    "client_ip": "2.2.2.2",
    "server_callback_url": "https://server.com/callback",
    "preauth": "Y",
    "version": "1.0.1",
    "card_number": "4444555566661111",
    "expiry_date": "0527",
    "cavv": "AEBBjhMvE4xRAg97n9DpAoABFA==",
    "wallet": "applepay"
    "signature": "64d565cdf9bfb2ad556eac54bd57706e5dc6c412",
  }
}
```

By following these steps, you can directly integrate with the Apple Pay API and process payments securely using decrypted card tokens.
