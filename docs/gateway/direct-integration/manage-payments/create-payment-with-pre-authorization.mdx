This guide provides step-by-step instructions for managing pre-authorization and capture operations, helping you efficiently handle two-stage payments with Fondy. This method involves two distinct steps:

* A **pre-authorization operation** to temporarily hold the transaction amount on the payer's card.
* A **capture operation** to charge the held amount, either whole or partially.

<Callout type="warning" title="Only Supported for Card Payments">
  Pre-authorization and capture are only supported for card payment methods. Other payment methods automatically process payments in a single-stage scheme, where the full amount is immediately charged.
</Callout>

This approach provides additional flexibility for merchants, allowing them to modify the transaction amount before capture or cancel the hold without incurring fees. Pre-authorization ensures that no financial movement occurs until the capture stage, offering an efficient way to manage transactions that require adjustments.

### Key Points

* Only one capture (full or partial) can be performed for each pre-authorization.
* If a partial capture is completed, the remaining amount is automatically refunded to the payer's cardâ€”no additional reversal is required.
* For transactions that have not been captured, the blocked amount can be instantly canceled without incurring fees.
* If you perform a partial capture, ensure the remaining amount does not also undergo reversal, as it may result in duplicate refunds.
* After a full capture, multiple partial reversals can be performed if needed.

Before proceeding to the step-by-step guide, make sure you know how to use your [Signature](/gateway/signatures) and that you have your Merchant ID (`merchant_id`). To get your Merchant ID, go to the [Fondy Dashboard](https://portal.fondy.eu/mportal/#/) and log in. In the left sidebar, select **Merchant Settings** and then **Technical**. You can copy the **Merchant ID** by clicking the green button to the right of the number.

## Creating a Pre-Authorization

To create the pre-authorization, follow the steps below. For more details, such as example request and responses, go to the [Create Payment](/gateway/direct-integration/manage-payments/create-payment) guide.

1. Prepare the request data with the required fields:

   * `server_callback_url`: Callback URL for payment updates.
   * `order_id`: Unique order identifier.
   * `currency`: Payment currency.
   * `order_desc`: Order description.
   * `amount`: Pre-authorization amount.
   * `merchant_id`: Your merchant ID.
   * `signature`: The request signature.
   * `preauth`: When creating a pre-authorization operation, this parameter should be informed as `Y`.

2. Use your preferred protocol to send a `POST` request to the [Accept Purchase endpoint](/reference/gateway/accept-purchase-fondy-checkout).

<Callout type="info">
  The supported protocols for this request are:

  * **URL-encoded form**
  * **XML**
  * **JSON**
</Callout>

3. Handle the response to retrieve the `checkout_url` and use it to redirect the customer to complete the payment.
4. After finishing, Fondy will send a `POST` request with the final payment information to the `server_callback_url` containing all the information from the processed payment. For more details, access the [Callbacks](/gateway/direct-integration/callbacks) guide.

## Creating a Capture

After the pre-authorization was created, you can create a capture operation, by following the steps below:

1. Prepare the request data with the required fields:

   * `order_id`: Unique order identifier.
   * `merchant_id`: Your merchant ID.
   * `signature`: The request signature.
   * `amount`: Capture amount. This amount can be different from the pre-authorized amount.
   * `currency`: Payment currency.

2. Use your preferred protocol to send a `POST` request to the [Capture Pre-Authorized Payment endpoint](/reference/gateway/capture-pre-auth-payment).

3. Check the response to make sure the capture has successful.
