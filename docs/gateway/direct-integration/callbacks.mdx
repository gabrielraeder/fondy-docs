Fondy uses callbacks to notify merchants when a payment is completed. To ensure callback notifications are received successfully, follow the instructions presented on this page.

## Allow Fondy's Server IP Addresses

Update your firewall settings to allow traffic from the following IP addresses:

* `54.154.216.60`

This ensures that callback responses from Fondy can reach your server.

## Processing Callback Responses

A callback is considered successfully processed if your server responds with an HTTP `200 OK` status. If a different status code is returned, Fondy will retry sending the callback at the following intervals (in seconds):

* 2 seconds
* 60 seconds
* 300 seconds
* 600 seconds
* 3600 seconds
* 86400 seconds (24 hours)

Ensure your system is configured to handle retries appropriately.

## Callback Request Details

Fondy sends callback requests with the following `User-Agent` header:
